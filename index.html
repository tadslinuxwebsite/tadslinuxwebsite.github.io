        <h1>What is linux?</h1>
        <p>Gnu/Linux is a family of operating systems that is open source and free for anybody to use. Linux makes up the kernel part of the operating system and was created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. A kernel is a computer program in an operating system that has control over the system and gives it the instructions needed to carry out certain tasks. Gnu is a operating system inspired by Unix, development of Gnu was started in 1984 and was created by Richard Stallman. Linux gives users the ability to have complete control over their computer and It's used in many advanced fields for that exact reason. </p>

        <h1 class="distros">Distros</h1>
        <p>Linux comes in many different distributions or "distros" which all have different philosophies and use cases. Some distros may use different package managers such as Pacman, Apt, or Dnf which help you install applications through the terminal. Different distros will use different desktop environments such as GNOME, KDE, or Xfce. Desktop environments are what you use to interact with the computer through a graphical user interface (GUI). Different distros will also have different levels of intensity, certain distros like linux mint are meant for beginners and users who don't want to do much setting up after installation while distros like Arch and Gentoo are mean't who users who want complete and ultimate control over their computer. This control that the more advanced distros give you also requires you to learn more about Linux and technology as a whole.</p>

        <h1 class="question1">Should you run Linux?</h1>
        <p>Not necessarily. Taking the leap from Windows or Mac OS to Linux might provide you with trouble, some software doesn't work out of the box and compatibility tools can sometimes be clunky or just not work. Linux is very good however for providing users with security and complete freedom of their system, It also provides you with more customization out of the box than Windows or Mac OS. Gaming is actually very good on Linux due to Steam proton allowing for more Windows exclusive games to run on Linux, there are also other tools such as Lutris and Wine which allow you to run Windows games and programs.</p>
