        <h2>Welcome</h2>
       <p>Hello my name is Tad, I'm sixteen years old and this is my new website based on technology. I will cover various topics about the things that interest me and I hope it can possibly be entertaining or even educational. Some of my favorite technology related things include Linux and programming. I've been using linux for around 8 months and It's been great, Linux provides me with the ability to do whatever I want with my system and I love it for that. I've been programming for a little over 9 months, the only languages I know so far are Python, HTML, and CSS. I hope to learn more about technology soon and I want to go to college for computer science.
           <br><br>
           I think that everyone should try to get into technology at one point whether it be with software or hardware. Technology is a really versatile thing and can lead to lots of opporunities in life for learning and even job opporunities. If you're up to it you should try to learn a programming language, it is a very fulfilling activity and learning something new is always fun (at least in my opinion).

       <h2>Why do I use linux</h2>
       <p>You probably didn't ask this but I use linux for the freedom it gives me. I have control over my entire computer and can do just about anything I want with it. It also provides me with security and protection from telemetry. The distros I recommend are Manjaro, Linux Mint, and Pop!_OS.</p>
