        <p>So last night I attempted to cheat on Pop!_OS with Xubuntu but then I realized that I really disliked Xubuntu and switched back to Pop!_OS within like 2 hours. It lead to me getting really poor sleep as I had stayed up until around 1:30 AM setting up a system twice. I realized that Pop!_OS is a truly great distro that feels really nice to use and is backed by a big team of developers and people that genuinely care about the project. Anyways I think this is all for tonight, tommorow I might continue learning Java which would actually be very useful. In the future I also want to learn C and Ruby.</p>

        <p>So I've been using Pop!_OS for a good while and I've tried a fair amount of distros such as Arch, Manjaro, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, and Debian. It appears that out of all of those distros Pop!_OS is the most enjoyable for me to use. It uses a modified version of the GNOME desktop and it seems to be really good for gaming. I installed powertop and tlp today and it has already shown to be really effective at preserving my battery life. Also I think Arch is the best distro for customization, I used it briefly but just didn't feel like it would fit me. I enjoy the more beginner friendly distros because I can end up getting work done quicker instead of configuring bluetooth drivers for 30 minutes.</p>
