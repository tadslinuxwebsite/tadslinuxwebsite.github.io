        <h2>December 7th 2021</h2>
        <p>Man only 18 more days until Christmas! The things I'm most excited for are my mechanical keyboard, and my books on programming and linux. Also today I got a new desk for my computer and It's incredibly nice, I have enough room to sprawl out if needed and it feels really legit.</p>

        <p>I am struggling to find something else to add to this website. I'm sure I'll figure it out soon but It's taking me a while. I'm still really interested in open source software and I've begun to take a leave from Facebook and Instagram as I don't agree with their practices, I hope eventually I can move almost entirely from proprietary software with a few exceptions. Also I made a 97.2% on my geometry test today which I'm pretty proud of. Anyways, hopefully I figure out something new to add to this website, maintaining the blog is not satisfying me. </p>

        <p>I kind of want to get the thinkpad t60 from the early 2000s. It looks really cool and I could libreboot it to where the bios is open source and stuff. Something about being able to control absolutely everything about a computer is so awesome to me. The only problem right now is that I don't have a job so I should start working on that soon. Typing this blog post in Graphic Design right now and it's 1:17 pm. Oh also I discovered how to find someones IP address yesterday, in order to successfully do this without much effort I would just need to send them a link that grabs their IP address and returns it to me. I'm sure there's a better and more efficient way of doing it but I don't actually care that much about getting peoples IP addresses, there's not that much you can even do with an IP address anyways.</p>

        <p>That didn't last long! I'm not on mint anymore because it decided to break on me 2 days into using it. I've switched to fedora and I'm enjoying it a lot so far, performance is so much better on fedora than mint and it just feels good to use. Also I finished my essay for national honors society so that's pretty neat :)

        <h2>Nov 25th 2021</h2>
        <p>So basically I was having trouble getting sound to work properly on Pop!_OS and I decided to just switch distros again. I heavily dislike distro hopping but I felt it was the only way the escape my problem. I am currently on Linux Mint and everything seems to be going well. I have noticed that my system feels slightly more sluggish in terms of graphical performance but I'm sure I can fix that soon. Also I'm getting a new desk for my computer and I am super excited about it, my current desk is really tiny and anything bigger would be an improvement. The new desk is going to be 55" and my current one is only 36" so it's safe to say I'll be more comfortable.</p>

        <h2>Nov 18th 2021</h2>
        <p>Nothing much has happened today but I figured out what I wanted for christmas from my grandma. I'm going to ask for the anne pro 2 keyboard and a book about Java. I would like to learn both Java and C before I get into college.</p>

        <h2>Nov 17th 2021</h2>
        <p>So last night I attempted to cheat on Pop!_OS with Xubuntu but then I realized that I really disliked Xubuntu and switched back to Pop!_OS within like 2 hours. It lead to me getting really poor sleep as I had stayed up until around 1:30 AM setting up a system twice. I realized that Pop!_OS is a truly great distro that feels really nice to use and is backed by a big team of developers and people that genuinely care about the project. Anyways I think this is all for tonight, tommorow I might continue learning Java which would actually be very useful. In the future I also want to learn C and Ruby.</p>

        <h2>Nov 16th 2021</h2>
        <p>So I've been using Pop!_OS for a good while and I've tried a fair amount of distros such as Arch, Manjaro, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, and Debian. It appears that out of all of those distros Pop!_OS is the most enjoyable for me to use. It uses a modified version of the GNOME desktop and it seems to be really good for gaming. I installed powertop and tlp today and it has already shown to be really effective at preserving my battery life. Also I think Arch is the best distro for customization, I used it briefly but just didn't feel like it would fit me. I enjoy the more beginner friendly distros because I can end up getting work done quicker instead of configuring bluetooth drivers for 30 minutes.</p>

       <p>Hello! This is my first blog entry in my Linux based website. This section of the website is going to be dedicated to talking about different Linux or technology related things. I plan on updating it semi frequently when I find something to write about. Hope everyone who sees this is doing well, goodbye.</p>
