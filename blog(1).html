        <p>So basically I was having trouble getting sound to work properly on Pop!_OS and I decided to just switch distros again. I heavily dislike distro hopping but I felt it was the only way the escape my problem. I am currently on Linux Mint and everything seems to be going well. I have noticed that my system feels slightly more sluggish in terms of graphical performance but I'm sure I can fix that soon. Also I'm getting a new desk for my computer and I am super excited about it, my current desk is really tiny and anything bigger would be an improvement. The new desk is going to be 55" and my current one is only 36" so it's safe to say I'll be more comfortable.</p>

        <p>Nothing much has happened today but I figured out what I wanted for christmas from my grandma. I'm going to ask for the anne pro 2 keyboard and a book about Java. I would like to learn both Java and C before I get into college.</p>

        <p>So last night I attempted to cheat on Pop!_OS with Xubuntu but then I realized that I really disliked Xubuntu and switched back to Pop!_OS within like 2 hours. It lead to me getting really poor sleep as I had stayed up until around 1:30 AM setting up a system twice. I realized that Pop!_OS is a truly great distro that feels really nice to use and is backed by a big team of developers and people that genuinely care about the project. Anyways I think this is all for tonight, tommorow I might continue learning Java which would actually be very useful. In the future I also want to learn C and Ruby.</p>

        <h2>Nov 16th 2021</h2>
        <p>So I've been using Pop!_OS for a good while and I've tried a fair amount of distros such as Arch, Manjaro, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Zorin OS, and Debian. It appears that out of all of those distros Pop!_OS is the most enjoyable for me to use. It uses a modified version of the GNOME desktop and it seems to be really good for gaming. I installed powertop and tlp today and it has already shown to be really effective at preserving my battery life. Also I think Arch is the best distro for customization, I used it briefly but just didn't feel like it would fit me. I enjoy the more beginner friendly distros because I can end up getting work done quicker instead of configuring bluetooth drivers for 30 minutes.</p>

       <p>Hello! This is my first blog entry in my Linux based website. This section of the website is going to be dedicated to talking about different Linux or technology related things. I plan on updating it semi frequently when I find something to write about. Hope everyone who sees this is doing well, goodbye.</p>
